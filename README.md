# thrifty
This classifier extension highlights Thrift keywords in order to make development easier.

It currently supports the following keywords;

- union
- struct
- include
- namespace
- required
- optional

Future plans include adding in intellisense options and further keywords. Much of the credit goes to the Ook Implementation Sample created by Microsoft.

It should be considered BETA and is released as-is. Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request. Any issues can also be raised via GitHub.
