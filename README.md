# thrifty
This classifier extension highlights Thrift keywords in order to make development easier.

It currently supports the following keywords;

- union
- struct
- include
- namespace
- required
- optional
- double
- i64
- i32
- bool
- string (code in place, commented out as it's causing exceptions/conflicts, need to investigate further).

Much of the credit goes to the Ook Implementation Sample created by Microsoft.

It should be considered BETA and is released as-is. Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request. Any issues can also be raised via GitHub.
